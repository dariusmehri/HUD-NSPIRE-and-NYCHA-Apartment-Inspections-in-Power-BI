### HUD NSPIRE and NYCHA Apartment Inspections in Power BI

This project implemented the use of Python to develop data-engineering algorithms that converted several incoherent HUD inspection reports into a unified, analysis-ready dataset for visualization in Power BI. This gave commissioner-level managers easy access for performance tracking, compare NYCHA inspection outcomes, and accelerate progress toward compliance and improved building safety.

The most important challenge was to convert non-text readable independent inspection reports into text readable data that could be input into Power BI for visualization. Once the data was converted into text,  the next step was to develop algorithms to transform the unstructured data into a structured csv files for visualization. Both of these steps were accomplished by developing data engineering algorithms in Python.
