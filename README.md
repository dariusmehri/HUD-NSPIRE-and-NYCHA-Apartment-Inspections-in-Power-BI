HUD NSPIRE and NYCHA Apartment Inspections in Power BI

This projected implemented the use of Python to develop data-engineering algorithms that converted several incoherent HUD inspection reports into a unified, analysis-ready dataset for visualization in Power BI. This gave commissioner-level managers easy access for performance tracking, compare NYCHA inspection outcomes, and accelerate progress toward compliance and improved building safety.
